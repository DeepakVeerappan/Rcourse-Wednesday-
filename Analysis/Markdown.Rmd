## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



##data summary Root
```{r compensation, echo=FALSE}
summary(compensation$Root)
```

## Including web image

##color by catagories
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(compensation, aes(x=Root, y=Fruit, col=Grazing))+
  geom_point(size=4)+
  ylab("Fruit(pecs)")+
  xlab("Root(mm)")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
